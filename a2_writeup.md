# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
Something that was difficult for me while completing the match function was step number 2. I was confused on how to start the function and there was a lot of trial and error in regards to how I set it up. Since there were a lot of lines of code, I messed up that step a lot more.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
The match funciton allows for extraction of information in a movie database. If a user inputs a certain movie, date, or actor, the match function will take in the user input and give an output that matches what the user put. Example: If a user wants to know specific movies that Tom Hanks was in, match database will look for Tom Hanks movies and output a list of movies he's in.
